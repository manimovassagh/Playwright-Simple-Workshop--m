# New-Gen E2E vs. Legacy Stack

---

## 🚀 New-Gen (Playwright, Cypress)

- **Native auto-wait & retries** → fewer flaky tests  
- **Modern browser control** (CDP/bi-directional) → faster, richer APIs  
- **Tight dev experience**: live reload, time-travel, trace viewer  
- **Network control**: request/response stubbing & HAR replay built-in  
- **First-class parallelism & sharding** (easy CI scaling)  
- **Cross-browser parity** (Playwright: Chromium, WebKit, Firefox; mobile emulation)  
- **Built-in test runner & fixtures** (config, isolation, screenshots, videos)  
- **Component testing** (Cypress; Playwright CT as well)  
- **Smart selectors** (role/ARIA, text, testId) with Shadow DOM/iframes support  

---

## 🏛 Legacy (Selenium, Ranorex, Robot, etc.)

- **Driver-based** control → slower round-trips, more flakiness  
- **Ecosystem assembly required** (runner, waits, reports, retries)  
- **Heavier setup/maintenance**, grid complexity  
- **Limited built-ins** for network mocking, tracing, videos  
- **Inconsistent parallelism** & slower CI feedback loops  
- **Stronger GUI/desktop coverage** (Ranorex) and **keyword-driven** options (Robot)  
- **Huge community & language breadth** (Selenium)
