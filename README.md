ig Players in Test Automation

✅ Playwright – Modern, fast, cross-browser, supports multiple languages
✅ Selenium – The classic pioneer, widely adopted, huge ecosystem
✅ Cypress – Popular for frontend testing, strong developer experience
✅ Ranorex – Commercial, GUI-focused, enterprise-friendly
✅ Robot Framework – Keyword-driven, versatile, easy for non-developers

⸻

New-Gen (Playwright, Cypress)
	•	Native auto-wait & retries → fewer flaky tests
	•	Modern browser control (CDP/bi-directional) → faster, richer APIs
	•	Tight dev experience: live reload, time-travel, trace viewer
	•	Network control: request/response stubbing & HAR replay built-in
	•	First-class parallelism & sharding (easy CI scaling)
	•	Cross-browser parity (PW: Chromium, WebKit, Firefox; mobile emulation)
	•	Built-in test runner & fixtures (config, isolation, screenshots, videos)
	•	Component testing (esp. Cypress; PW via CT too)
	•	Smart selectors (role/ARIA, text, testId) & Shadow DOM/iframes support

Legacy (Selenium, Ranorex, Robot, etc.)
	•	Driver-based control → slower round-trips, more flakiness
	•	Ecosystem assembly required (runner, waits, reports, retries)
	•	Heavier setup/maintenance, grid complexity
	•	Limited built-ins for network mocking, tracing, videos
	•	Inconsistent parallelism & slower CI feedback loops
	•	Stronger GUI/desktop coverage (Ranorex) and keyword-driven options (Robot)
	•	Huge community & language breadth (Selenium)
